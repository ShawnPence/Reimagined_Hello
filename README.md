# Reimagined_Hello

A collection of projects reimagining the traditional "Hello, World!" in unconventional, unusual, or needlessly complicated (but fun) ways.

## Purpose

Having previously worked for compaines that had closed-source projects, and my free time happily consumed by my kids, I've had little time in the past to program for fun or to build a publicly viewable portfolio.  I wanted my repository to have something creative and out of the ordinary and decided to try non-traditional versions of a classic first program.

## Projects

**001_bogosort_hello (C# console app)** - Randomize the order of the letters in "Hello" and repeat the randomization until a random sort falls back into the expected order of the original word. *(Factorial-time algorithms to start the project list... why not?)*  Bogosort process (as many shuffles as needed to succeed) is repeated a total of 10 times and statistics on fewest/most/average shuffles needed to sort letters into the word "Hello" are displayed.

**002_mod_hello (Python)** - Print integers in order substituting "Hello" for all integers divisible by 3, "World" for all integers divisible by 5, and "HelloWorld" for all integers divisible by both 3 and 5.  *(an homage to FizzBuzz)*

**003_cross_join (T-SQL)** - Cross-join the letters H,e,l,o to each other 5 times and select only the word Hello out of the 1024 rows the cross join would otherwise create.

**004_generator_expression (Python)** - Python generator expression used to return Hello World from all letters.
